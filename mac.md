Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

1. Git is a system that is used to help control and push projects to and from Github

2.Git is what is typed and used within the terminal, Github is a place where everything is stored.

3.So that we don't make mistakes on the main.

4. Pull requests lets me tell others what I have changed and pushed to a branch.

5.I think the command is cd then the name of the branch or if you want to go back up one you would do cd ..

6.I think git fetch is the safer version of git pull. It pulls the files without making any changes to my local files. I think git merge is putting all the files 
back to the main branch.

7.When multiple people are changing the same code.
